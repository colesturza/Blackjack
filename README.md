# Blackjack
Simple text based Blackjack game implemented with C++ for the final project in CSCI 1300. The game allows the player to play against any number of AI opponents that use card counting to make judgements on whether to pass or hit based on percentages and the difficulty of the AI. There is also implementation to save your current game and reload it whenever you feel like continuing. The game works off of rounds won rather than bets, so the way to win the game is to win the most rounds. The number of rounds, the difficulty of the AI, and the number of AI are all set at the beginning of the game.
